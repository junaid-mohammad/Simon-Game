# Simon Game

This repository contains the source code for an interactive **Simon Game**, a classic memory-based game built using **jQuery** and **JavaScript**. The game challenges players to replicate an increasingly complex sequence of button presses, making it both engaging and a great way to practice coding skills.

## Purpose

The motivation behind this project was to solidify my jQuery knowledge in a fun and interactive way. Inspired by the nostalgic Simon game, I aimed to recreate its functionality while learning key concepts like event handling, animations, and dynamic DOM manipulation. Building this game helped me practice and enhance my JavaScript skills in an enjoyable, hands-on manner.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players follow and replicate an ever-growing sequence of colors.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Button animations and sound effects provide real-time feedback for user interaction.
- **Score Display**: Displays the current level and announces the final score upon game over.
- **Error Feedback**: Visual and auditory indicators signal incorrect sequences.
- **Restart Option**: Easily restart the game after completing or failing a round.
- **Responsive Layout**: Designed for smooth play across devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structured the layout of the Simon Game interface.
- **CSS**: Styled the game with color-coded buttons, animations, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Implemented game logic, event handling, and interactivity.
- **jQuery**: Simplified DOM manipulation and event handling.
- **Audio API**: Played unique sounds for each button press.

## What I Learned

- Gained hands-on experience with **jQuery** for managing events and DOM updates.
- Practiced JavaScript concepts like random number generation, array manipulation, and function calls.
- Improved debugging and logic-building skills through complex game mechanics.
- Enhanced understanding of combining animations and sound effects for a polished user experience.
